# Synopsis
A bot to plays Tetris and the accompanying genetic algorithm used to make improvements.

# Motivation
I am a big fan of the game Tetris, and was interested in producing an AI that could play as well as humans (or hopefully better).

# Source
The actual game framework is from [here](https://gist.github.com/silvasur/565419). I made minor changes to the game itself, most notably I altered the piece selection methodology to follow that of the original Tetris game.
